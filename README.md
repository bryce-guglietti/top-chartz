Top Chartz is a React application that is modeled after Spotify's design. It allows users to search for songs, discover new songs, 
find top charts near them, sort charts by genre, 
find artist data, song lyrics, related songs, and play samples of songs. 

Application uses the Shazam-Core API to retrieve artist and song Data from Shazam's Database of 8 Million + songs. 
The Application also utilizes the IP GeoLocation API to determine where a user is located for the 'Around You' charts section.

React's framework made for an easy organization of components, constants, pages, and utilities. 

Worked with JavaScript, HTML + CSS to create this application.
